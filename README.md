# zcode2gcode

This is a Zortax's Z-Suite toolpath file called zcode converter to standard gcode commands which can be printed with rep-rap like machines such as CraftBot

ZSuite's output is now zcodex which is a zip file.
You have to extract ZCodeData from this zip and feed it to the converter as input file!
